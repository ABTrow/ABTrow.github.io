        Ah, yes mortal. I remember when I too did not know all that is past, present, and future. 
        The excitement! The thrill of the unknown! Surely this is why you, but a humble ant when compared 
        to my splendor, have sought me out. For though you, foolish mortal, do not know the number, 
        <strong>I do</strong>. Therefore, look upon my website and tremble. Through the arcane magic of basic HTML, 
        CSS, and JavaScript, I have wrought it. Behold how it tells you whether your guesses are hot or cold! 
        Behold it's tasteful styling! Behold how it crashes only intermittantly! 
        If ye be brave indeed, enter your guess:
